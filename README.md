Hello, world! My name is Mabiia, and I'm a CompSci student at the Universidad de Granada. 
I am passionate about exploring the domains of artificial intelligence and big data, and
I am eager to dive deep into these fields and absorb as much knowledge as possible.

Growing up in Las Palmas, a charming city situated on a small archipelago in Spain, 
I always knew that engineering was my calling. To chase my dreams, I made the bold 
decision to move to Granada and embark on this exciting journey. Living in a shared 
flat has helped me develop a sense of independence and self-reliance. Moreover, it 
has taught me the true value of hard work and teamwork. I am confident that this
experience will enable me to become a successful engineer who is not only knowledgeable 
but also a great team player.

As a student, I took it upon myself to coordinate the Equality Commission at the Technical 
School of Computer and Telecommunication Engineering. My primary goal was to foster a 
respectful and inclusive environment for all students, with a focus on protecting the safety 
and well-being of every member, especially those from minority groups.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have two hobbies that I cherish - reading and playing 
volleyball. Despite sustaining injuries that prevent me from playing volleyball anymore, 
my passion for the sport remains undiminished. Over the years, I have read books of all kinds, 
expanding my knowledge and broadening my horizons.
